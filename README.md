What is Valkey?

Valkey, is a Self Sovereign Identity build on Aadhar. In simple terms it is a digital Id created by combining the decentralized blockchain principle with identity verification, provides secure identity management, integrated with fingerprint and other biometry on personal devices. 

How it helps?

Centralized management of identities and KYC data is overwhelmed with so many disadvantages and security challenges that it is becoming a subject of serious concern especially in the age of wannacry and equifax hacks as most of the public data are usually stored in centralized servers with large storage capacity. Therefore, crucial information of a lot of people are held in one place. This exposes such stored data to a lot of risk.

Imagine a world where you are in direct control of your personal information, a world where you can limit and control how much information you share while retaining the ability to transact in the world. This is self-sovereign identity and It ensures privacy and trust, where transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable and endorsed by relevant, permissioned participants.

How it Works?
